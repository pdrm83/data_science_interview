# Kmeans Clustering
In Data Science interviews, you may be asked to solve general ML challenges focused on <b> Classification </b> or <b> Clustering </b>. These challenges aim to evaluate your general knowledge of machine learning. The company may work in the natural language processing or computer vision field. Nevertheless, they need to evaluate the general machine learning knowledge of their candidates. This project shows how to use the K-Means clustering algorithm. For more detailed description, you can read this article: [A Classic Example of ML Challenges in Data Science Interviews]()
